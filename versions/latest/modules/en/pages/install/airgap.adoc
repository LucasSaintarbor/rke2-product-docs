= Air-Gap Install

RKE2 can be installed in an air-gapped environment with two different methods. You can either deploy via the `rke2-airgap-images` tarball release artifact, or by using a private registry.

== Prerequisites

[CAUTION]
====
If your node has NetworkManager installed and enabled, xref:../known_issues.adoc#_networkmanager[ensure that it is configured to ignore CNI-managed interfaces].
====

All files mentioned in the steps can be obtained from the assets of the desired released RKE2 version https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases[here].

If running on an air-gapped node with SELinux enabled, you must manually install the necessary SELinux policy RPM before performing these steps. See our xref:./methods.adoc#_rpm[RPM Documentation] to determine what you need.

If running on an air-gapped node with SELinux enabled, the following are required dependencies for SLES, CentOS, or RHEL 8 when doing an xref:./methods.adoc#_rpm[RPM install]:

Installing dependencies: container-selinux iptables libnetfilter_conntrack libnfnetlink libnftnl policycoreutils-python-utils rke2-common rke2-selinux

All the steps listed on this document must be run as the root user or through `sudo`.

If your nodes do not have an interface with a default route, a default route must be configured; even a black-hole route via a dummy interface will suffice. RKE2 requires a default route in order to auto-detect the node's primary IP, and for kube-proxy ClusterIP routing to function properly. To add a dummy route, do the following:

[,bash]
----
  ip link add dummy0 type dummy
  ip link set dummy0 up
  ip addr add 203.0.113.254/31 dev dummy0
  ip route add default via 203.0.113.255 dev dummy0 metric 1000
----

== Tarball Method

. Download the airgap images tarballs from the RKE release artifacts list for the version and platform of RKE2 you are using.
 ** Use `rke2-images.linux-amd64.tar.zst`, or `rke2-images.linux-amd64.tar.gz` for releases prior to v1.20. Zstandard offers better compression ratios and faster decompression speeds compared to gzip.
 ** If using the default Canal CNI (`--cni=canal`), you can use either the `rke2-image` legacy archive as described above, or `rke2-images-core` and `rke2-images-canal` archives.
 ** If using the alternative Cilium CNI (`--cni=cilium`), you must download the `rke2-images-core` and `rke2-images-cilium` archives instead.
 ** If using your own CNI (`--cni=none`), you can download only the `rke2-images-core` archive.
 ** If enabling the vSphere CPI/CSI charts (`--cloud-provider-name=rancher-vsphere`), you must also download the `rke2-images-vsphere` archive.
. Ensure that the `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/images/` directory exists on the node.
. Copy the compressed archive to `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/images/` on the node, ensuring that the file extension is retained.
. <<Install RKE2>>.

== Private Registry Method

As of RKE2 v1.20, private registry support honors all settings from the xref:./containerd_registry_configuration.adoc[containerd registry configuration]. This includes endpoint override and transport protocol (HTTP/HTTPS), authentication, certificate verification, etc.

Prior to RKE2 v1.20, private registries must use TLS, with a cert trusted by the host CA bundle. If the registry is using a self-signed cert, you can add the cert to the host CA bundle with `update-ca-certificates`. The registry must also allow anonymous (unauthenticated) access.

. Add all the required system images to your private registry. A list of images can be obtained from the `.txt` file corresponding to each tarball referenced above, or you may `docker load` the airgap image tarballs, then tag and push the loaded images.
. If using a private or self-signed certificate on the registry, add the registry's CA cert to the containerd registry configuration, or operating system's trusted certs for releases prior to v1.20.
. <<Install RKE2>> using the `system-default-registry` parameter, or use the xref:./containerd_registry_configuration.adoc[containerd registry configuration] to use your registry as a mirror for docker.io.

== Install RKE2

The following options to install RKE2 should only be performed after completing one of either the <<Tarball Method>> or <<Private Registry Method>>.

RKE2 can be installed either by running the <<RKE2 Binary Install,binary>> directly or by using the <<RKE2 Install.sh Script Install,install.sh script>>.

=== RKE2 Binary Install

. Obtain the RKE2 binary file `rke2.linux-amd64`.
. Ensure the binary is named `rke2` and place it in `/usr/local/bin`. Ensure it is executable.
. Run the binary with the desired parameters. For example, if using the Private Registry Method, your config file would have the following:
+
[,yaml]
----
system-default-registry: "registry.example.com:5000"
----

NOTE: The `system-default-registry` parameter must specify only valid RFC 3986 URI authorities, i.e. a host and optional port.

=== RKE2 Install.sh Script Install

`install.sh` may be used in an offline mode by setting the `INSTALL_RKE2_ARTIFACT_PATH` variable to a path containing pre-downloaded artifacts. This will run though a normal install, including creating systemd units.

. Download the install script, rke2, rke2-images, and sha256sum archives from the release into a directory, as in the example below:
+
[,bash]
----
mkdir /root/rke2-artifacts && cd /root/rke2-artifacts/
curl -OLs https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/download/v1.26.10%2Brke2r2/rke2-images.linux-amd64.tar.zst
curl -OLs https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/download/v1.26.10%2Brke2r2/rke2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
curl -OLs https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/download/v1.26.10%2Brke2r2/sha256sum-amd64.txt
curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io --output install.sh
----

. Next, run install.sh using the directory, as in the example below:
+
[,bash]
----
INSTALL_RKE2_ARTIFACT_PATH=/root/rke2-artifacts sh install.sh
----

. Enable and run the service as outlined xref:./quickstart.adoc#_2_enable_the_rke2_server_service[here].
